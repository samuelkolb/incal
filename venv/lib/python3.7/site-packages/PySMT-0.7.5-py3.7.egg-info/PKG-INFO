Description: ============================================================
         pySMT: A library for SMT formulae manipulation and solving
        ============================================================
        
        pySMT makes working with Satisfiability Modulo Theory simple.
        
        Among others, you can:
        
        * Define formulae in a solver independent way in a simple and
          inutitive way,
        * Write ad-hoc simplifiers and operators,
        * Dump your problems in the SMT-Lib format,
        * Solve them using one of the native solvers, or by wrapping any
          SMT-Lib complaint solver.
        
        Supported Theories and Solvers
        ==============================
        pySMT provides methods to define a formula in Linear Real Arithmetic (LRA),
        Real Difference Logic (RDL), their combination (LIRA),
        Equalities and Uninterpreted Functions (EUF), Bit-Vectors (BV), and Arrays (A).
        The following solvers are supported through native APIs:
        
        * MathSAT (http://mathsat.fbk.eu/)
        * Z3 (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/)
        * CVC4 (http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/web/)
        * Yices 2 (http://yices.csl.sri.com/)
        * CUDD (http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/)
        * PicoSAT (http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/)
        * Boolector (http://fmv.jku.at/boolector/)
        
        Additionally, you can use any SMT-LIB 2 compliant solver.
        
        PySMT assumes that the python bindings for the SMT Solver are installed and
        accessible from your PYTHONPATH.
        
        pySMT works on both Python 3 and Python 2.
